      <h2>Metro</h2>
      <p>The Metro system is fast, clean, and reliable in Montreal, and covers most of the area in the city. There are four Metro lines in Montreal, named by colour:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Orange Line:</strong> This line runs east to north between Ville St-Laurent and Laval in an L-shape.</li>
        <li><strong>The Green Line:</strong> This line extends from Angrignon metro in the Sud-Ouest all the way to the Honoré-Beaugrand metro.</li>
        <li><strong>The Blue Line:</strong> The Blue line, which runs north of downtown Montreal from Snowdon metro in Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce to Saint Michel, connecting to the Orange line at Snowdon metro.</li>
        <li><strong>The Yellow Line:</strong> This line runs across the water from Berri-UQAM metro in Quartier Latin to Longueuil, connecting to both the Orange and Green lines.</li>

      <p>The STM bus will take you beyond the city centre to various suburbs and the airport. Buses run 24 hours a day, so they are a great choice when the Metro closes at midnight. Express buses are clearly marked for quick transport. You can use an OPUS card or exact change on the bus.</p>

      <h2>Exo Train</h2>
      <p>The Exo transit network consists of six commuter train lines throughout Greater Montreal, going to Vaudreuil-Hudson, Deux-Montagnes, Saint-Jerome, Mascouche, Mont-Saint-Hilaire, and Candiac. You can purchase TRAIN fares if you only use the Exo train, or a TRAM fare if you use multiple forms of transport. Either can be loaded onto your OPUS Card or a Solo card with one to six uses.</p>

    <div class="train-grid"><figure><img src="images/Taxibus.jpg"></figure>
      <h2>Taxibus</h2>
      <p>The Taxibus is a special bus service for routes not regularly serviced by public transit. You must book your Taxibus 40-60 minutes ahead of time, and normally you may share this ride with others. You can load your OPUS card with the proper Taxibus fares, as the Taxibus does not accept cash payment.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="questions-grid">
        <h3>Where can I buy a Montreal transit pass?</h3>
        <p>Passes can be purchased at kiosks in metro stations or from a fare collector. Bus fare can also be paid in cash and can be paid upon entering the bus at the driver’s door.
          TRAM fares can be purchased to cover Exo train, Metro, and bus travel in one combined pass, which can be loaded onto an OPUS card. TRAIN fares only cover travel on the Exo commuter train network.</p>
      </div><div class="questions-grid">
        <h3>How to use an OPUS card</h3>
        <p>The most common way to pay on Montreal transit is with an OPUS card, which can be purchased at fare collectors or vending machines in any metro station. You can load your OPUS card with any of the above fare options. OPUS cards can be purchased for $6.00 CAD, and are valid for one rider each. OPUS cards can be reloaded online or at kiosks throughout metro stations. It is advisable to register your OPUS card to protect the balance against theft or loss.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="questions-grid">
        <h3>Getting a transfer</h3>
        <p>With any type of fare, you can transfer between metro and bus lines without paying for a second ticket. You have 120 minutes to use this transfer. If you pay in change on the bus, you can get a paper transfer from the driver. If you have an OPUS card, it will be immediately calculated on your card.</p>
      </div><div class="questions-grid">
        <h3>Reduced fare: Students and seniors</h3>
        <p>Students of all ages (elementary to post-secondary) that study in a registered school can receive reduced fares on transit with a photo-identified OPUS card. Seniors over the age of 65 are also eligible for a reduced fare with a photo-identified OPUS card.</p>

        <h3>Car sharing in Montreal with your OPUS card</h3>
        <p>The province of Quebec is one of the oldest users of car-sharing services. OPUS card packages can be purchased from Communauto, the carsharing company in Montreal, to integrate your metro, bus, and carshare use into one card. Your OPUS card can then be used to unlock a Communauto vehicle, whenever you need it. You can use the Communauto app to find nearby vehicles and Communauto parking spaces.</p>
      </div><div class="questions-grid">
        <h3>Can you bring your bike on the metro or bus?</h3>
        <p>Combining cycling and public transit is a great way to cut down on your energy emissions, get exercise, and travel far distances, all while saving money that you might have spent on vehicle costs. You can bring your bicycle on the metro at non-peak times in the front car of the metro.</p>
